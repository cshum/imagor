# Image Endpoint

imagor endpoint is a series of URL parts which defines the image operations, followed by the image URI:

```
/HASH|unsafe/trim/AxB:CxD/fit-in/stretch/-Ex-F/GxH:IxJ/HALIGN/VALIGN/smart/filters:NAME(ARGS):NAME(ARGS):.../IMAGE
```

- `HASH` is the URL signature hash, or `unsafe` if unsafe mode is used
- `trim` removes surrounding space in images using top-left pixel color
- `AxB:CxD` means manually crop the image at left-top point `AxB` and right-bottom point `CxD`. Coordinates can also be provided as float values between 0 and 1 (percentage of image dimensions)
- `fit-in` means that the generated image should not be auto-cropped and otherwise just fit in an imaginary box specified by `ExF`
- `stretch` means resize the image to `ExF` without keeping its aspect ratios
- `-Ex-F` means resize the image to be `ExF` of width per height size. The minus signs mean flip horizontally and vertically
- `GxH:IxJ` add left-top padding `GxH` and right-bottom padding `IxJ`
- `HALIGN` is horizontal alignment of crop. Accepts `left`, `right` or `center`, defaults to `center`
- `VALIGN` is vertical alignment of crop. Accepts `top`, `bottom` or `middle`, defaults to `middle`
- `smart` means using smart detection of focal points
- `filters` a pipeline of image filter operations to be applied, see filters section
- `IMAGE` is the image path or URI
  - For image URI that contains `?` character, this will interfere the URL query and should be encoded with [`encodeURIComponent`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/encodeURIComponent) or equivalent
  - Base64 URLs: Use `b64:` prefix to encode image URLs with special characters as [base64url](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Base64#url_and_filename_safe_base64). This encoding is  more robust if you have special characters in your image URL, and can fix encoding/signing issues in your setup.


:::danger Security Warning
Never use `unsafe` in production environments. Always use URL signing with `IMAGOR_SECRET`.

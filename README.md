imagor is a fast, secure image processing server and Go library.

imagor uses one of the most efficient image processing library
[libvips](https://github.com/libvips/libvips) with Go binding [vipsgen](https://github.com/cshum/vipsgen). It is typically 4-8x [faster](https://github.com/libvips/libvips/wiki/Speed-and-memory-use) than using the quickest ImageMagick settings.
imagor implements libvips [streaming](https://www.libvips.org/2019/11/29/True-streaming-for-libvips.html) that facilitates parallel processing pipelines, achieving high network throughput.

imagor features a ton of image processing use cases, available as a HTTP server with first-class Docker support. It adopts the [thumbor](https://thumbor.readthedocs.io/en/latest/usage.html#image-endpoint) URL syntax representing a high-performance drop-in replacement.

imagor is a Go library built with speed, security and extensibility in mind. Alongside there is [imagorvideo](https://github.com/cshum/imagorvideo) bringing video thumbnail capability through ffmpeg C bindings.

### Image Endpoint

imagor endpoint is a series of URL parts which defines the image operations, followed by the image URI:

```
/HASH|unsafe/trim/AxB:CxD/fit-in/stretch/-Ex-F/GxH:IxJ/HALIGN/VALIGN/smart/filters:NAME(ARGS):NAME(ARGS):.../IMAGE
```

- `HASH` is the URL signature hash, or `unsafe` if unsafe mode is used
- `trim` removes surrounding space in images using top-left pixel color
- `AxB:CxD` means manually crop the image at left-top point `AxB` and right-bottom point `CxD`. Coordinates can also be provided as float values between 0 and 1 (percentage of image dimensions)
- `fit-in` means that the generated image should not be auto-cropped and otherwise just fit in an imaginary box specified by `ExF`
- `stretch` means resize the image to `ExF` without keeping its aspect ratios
- `-Ex-F` means resize the image to be `ExF` of width per height size. The minus signs mean flip horizontally and vertically
- `GxH:IxJ` add left-top padding `GxH` and right-bottom padding `IxJ`
- `HALIGN` is horizontal alignment of crop. Accepts `left`, `right` or `center`, defaults to `center`
- `VALIGN` is vertical alignment of crop. Accepts `top`, `bottom` or `middle`, defaults to `middle`
- `smart` means using smart detection of focal points
- `filters` a pipeline of image filter operations to be applied, see filters section
- `IMAGE` is the image path or URI
  - For image URI that contains `?` character, this will interfere the URL query and should be encoded with [`encodeURIComponent`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/encodeURIComponent) or equivalent
  - Base64 URLs: Use `b64:` prefix to encode image URLs with special characters as [base64url](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Base64#url_and_filename_safe_base64). This encoding is  more robust if you have special characters in your image URL, and can fix encoding/signing issues in your setup.

### Filters

Filters `/filters:NAME(ARGS):NAME(ARGS):.../` is a pipeline of image operations that will be sequentially applied to the image. Examples:

```
/filters:fill(white):format(jpeg)/
/filters:hue(290):saturation(100):fill(yellow):format(jpeg):quality(80)/
/filters:fill(white):watermark(raw.githubusercontent.com/cshum/imagor/master/testdata/gopher-front.png,repeat,bottom,10):format(jpeg)/
```

imagor supports the following filters:

- `fill(color)` fill the missing area or transparent image with the specified color:
  - `color` - color name or hexadecimal rgb expression without the “#” character
    - If color is "blur" - missing parts are filled with blurred original image
    - If color is "auto" - the top left image pixel will be chosen as the filling color
    - If color is "none" - the filling would become fully transparent
- `focal(AxB:CxD)` or `focal(X,Y)` adds a focal region or focal point for custom transformations:
  - Coordinated by a region of left-top point `AxB` and right-bottom point `CxD`, or a point `X,Y`.
  - Also accepts float values between 0 and 1 that represents percentage of image dimensions.
- `format(format)` specifies the output format of the image
  - `format` accepts jpeg, png, gif, webp, avif, jxl, tiff, jp2
- `grayscale()` changes the image to grayscale
- `hue(angle)` increases or decreases the image hue
  - `angle` the angle in degree to increase or decrease the hue rotation
- `label(text, x, y, size, color[, alpha[, font]])` adds a text label to the image. It can be positioned inside the image with the alignment specified, color and transparency support:
  - `text` text label, also support url encoded text.
  - `x` horizontal position that the text label will be in:
    - Positive number indicate position from the left, negative number from the right.
    - Number followed by a `p` e.g. 20p means calculating the value from the image width as percentage
    - `left`,`right`,`center` align left, right or centered respectively
  - `y` vertical position that the text label will be in:
    - Positive number indicate position from the top, negative number from the bottom.

- `to_colorspace(profile)` converts the image to the specified ICC color profile
  - `profile` the target color profile, defaults to `srgb` if not specified. Common values: `srgb`, `p3`, `cmyk`
- `upscale()` upscale the image if `fit-in` is used
- `watermark(image, x, y, alpha [, w_ratio [, h_ratio]])` adds a watermark to the image. It can be positioned inside the image with the alpha channel specified and optionally resized based on the image size by specifying the ratio
  - `image` watermark image URI, using the same image loader configured for imagor.
    Use `b64:` prefix to encode image URLs with special characters as [base64url](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Base64#url_and_filename_safe_base64).
  - `x` horizontal position that the watermark will be in:
    - Positive number indicate position from the left, negative number from the right.

    - Positive number indicate position from the top, negative number from the bottom.
    - Number followed by a `p` e.g. 20p means calculating the value from the image height as percentage
    - `top`,`bottom`,`center` positioned top, bottom or centered respectively
    - `repeat` the watermark will be repeated vertically
  - `alpha` watermark image transparency, a number between 0 (fully opaque) and 100 (fully transparent).
  - `w_ratio` percentage of the width of the image the watermark should fit-in
  - `h_ratio` percentage of the height of the image the watermark should fit-in

#### Utility Filters

These filters do not manipulate images but provide useful utilities to the imagor pipeline:

- `attachment(filename)` returns attachment in the `Content-Disposition` header, and the browser will open a "Save as" dialog with `filename`. When `filename` not specified, imagor will get the filename from the image source
- `expire(timestamp)` adds expiration time to the content. `timestamp` is the unix milliseconds timestamp, e.g. if content is valid for 30s then timestamp would be `Date.now() + 30*1000` in JavaScript.
- `preview()` skips the result storage even if result storage is enabled. Useful for conditional caching
- `raw()` response with a raw unprocessed and unchecked source image. Image still loads from loader and storage but skips the result storage


### Loader, Storage and Result Storage

imagor `Loader`, `Storage` and `Result Storage` are the building blocks for loading and saving images from various sources:

- `Loader` loads image. Enable `Loader` where you wish to load images from, but without modifying it e.g. static directory.
- `Storage` loads and saves image. This allows subsequent requests for the same image loads directly from the storage, instead of HTTP source.
- `Result Storage` loads and saves the processed image. This allows subsequent request of the same parameters loads from the result storage, saving processing resources.

imagor provides built-in adaptors that support HTTP(s), Proxy, File System, AWS S3 and Google Cloud Storage. By default, `HTTP Loader` is used as fallback. You can choose to enable additional adaptors that fit your use cases.

#### File System

Docker Compose example with file system, using mounted volume:

```yaml
version: "3"
services:
  imagor:
    image: shumc/imagor:latest
    volumes:
      - ./:/mnt/data
    environment:
      PORT: 8000
      IMAGOR_UNSAFE: 1 # unsafe URL for testing

      FILE_LOADER_BASE_DIR: /mnt/data # enable file loader by specifying base dir

      FILE_STORAGE_BASE_DIR: /mnt/data # enable file storage by specifying base dir
      FILE_STORAGE_MKDIR_PERMISSION: 0755 # optional
      FILE_STORAGE_WRITE_PERMISSION: 0666 # optional

      FILE_RESULT_STORAGE_BASE_DIR: /mnt/data/result # enable file result storage by specifying base dir
      FILE_RESULT_STORAGE_MKDIR_PERMISSION: 0755 # optional
      FILE_RESULT_STORAGE_WRITE_PERMISSION: 0666 # optional
      
    ports:
      - "8000:8000"
```

#### AWS S3

Docker Compose example with AWS S3. Also works with S3 compatible such as MinIO, DigitalOcean Space.

```yaml
version: "3"
services:
  imagor:
    image: shumc/imagor:latest
    environment:
      PORT: 8000
      IMAGOR_SECRET: mysecret # secret key for URL signature
      AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID: ...
      AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY: ...
      AWS_REGION: ...

      S3_LOADER_BUCKET: mybucket # enable S3 loader by specifying bucket
      S3_LOADER_BASE_DIR: images # optional

      S3_STORAGE_BUCKET: mybucket # enable S3 storage by specifying bucket
      S3_STORAGE_BASE_DIR: images # optional
      S3_STORAGE_ACL: public-read # optional - see https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/acl-overview.html#canned-acl

      S3_RESULT_STORAGE_BUCKET: mybucket # enable S3 result storage by specifying bucket
      S3_RESULT_STORAGE_BASE_DIR: images/result # optional
      S3_RESULT_STORAGE_ACL: public-read # optional
    ports:
      - "8000:8000"
```

##### Custom S3 Endpoint

Configure custom S3 endpoint for S3 compatible such as MinIO, DigitalOcean Space:

```yaml
      S3_ENDPOINT: http://minio:9000
      S3_FORCE_PATH_STYLE: 1
```

By default, S3 prepends bucket name as subdomain to the request URL:

```
http://mybucket.minio:9000/image.jpg
```

this may not be desirable for a self-hosted endpoint. You can also switch to [path-style requests](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/VirtualHosting.html#path-style-access) using `S3_FORCE_PATH_STYLE=1` such that the host remains unchanged:

```
http://minio:9000/mybucket/image.jpg
```

##### Different AWS Credentials for S3 Loader, Storage and Result Storage

Set the following environment variables to override the global AWS Credentials for S3 Loader, Storage and Result Storage:

```dotenv
AWS_LOADER_REGION
AWS_LOADER_ACCESS_KEY_ID
AWS_LOADER_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY
S3_LOADER_ENDPOINT

AWS_STORAGE_REGION
AWS_STORAGE_ACCESS_KEY_ID
AWS_STORAGE_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY
S3_STORAGE_ENDPOINT

AWS_RESULT_STORAGE_REGION
AWS_RESULT_STORAGE_ACCESS_KEY_ID
AWS_RESULT_STORAGE_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY
S3_RESULT_STORAGE_ENDPOINT
```

##### S3 Loader Bucket Routing

For multi-tenant or multi-bucket setups, you can route image requests to different S3 buckets based on pattern matching. Each bucket can have its own region, endpoint, and credentials. Create a YAML configuration file:

```yaml
# Regex pattern with named capture group (?P<bucket>...)
# Extracts the bucket identifier from the object key
routing_pattern: "^[a-f0-9]{4}-(?P<bucket>[A-Za-z0-9]+)-"

default_bucket:
  name: imagor-default
  region: us-east-1

fallback_buckets:
  - name: imagor-archive
    region: us-west-2

rules:
  - match: SG
    bucket:
      name: imagor-singapore
      region: ap-southeast-1
  - match: US
    bucket:
      name: imagor-us
      region: us-east-1
  - match: EU
    bucket:
      name: imagor-eu
      region: eu-west-1
      endpoint: https://s3.custom-endpoint.com
      access_key_id: AKIAIOSFODNN7EXAMPLE
      secret_access_key: wJalrXUtnFEMI/K7MDENG/bPxRfiCYEXAMPLEKEY
```

**Pattern Examples:**

| Use Case | `routing_pattern` | Example Key | Extracted Value |
|----------|-------------------|-------------|-----------------|
| Random prefix with bucket code | `^[a-f0-9]{4}-(?P<bucket>[A-Z]{2})-` | `f7a3-SG-image.jpg` | `SG` |
| Simple prefix routing | `^(?P<bucket>[^/]+)/` | `users/photo.jpg` | `users` |
| Region-based naming | `(?P<bucket>[a-z]{2}-[a-z]+-\d)` | `eu-west-1-img.jpg` | `eu-west-1` |

Then specify the config file path:

```dotenv
S3_LOADER_BUCKET_ROUTER_CONFIG=/path/to/bucket-routing.yaml
```

Or via command line:

```bash
imagor -s3-loader-bucket-router-config /path/to/bucket-routing.yaml
```

Routing behavior:
- The `routing_pattern` must contain a named capture group `(?P<bucket>...)` to extract the bucket identifier
- The extracted value is matched against `rules[].match` to find the target bucket
- If no rule matches, the `default_bucket` is used
- If image not found in primary bucket, `fallback_buckets` are tried in order (up to 2 fallbacks)
- Each bucket config can specify its own `region`, `endpoint`, and credentials
- If bucket-specific credentials are not provided, global AWS credentials are used
- If `S3_LOADER_BUCKET` is not set, `default_bucket.name` from the config is used

Docker Compose example with bucket routing:

```yaml
version: "3"
services:
  imagor:
    image: shumc/imagor:latest
    volumes:
      - ./bucket-routing.yaml:/etc/imagor/bucket-routing.yaml
    environment:
      PORT: 8000
      IMAGOR_SECRET: mysecret
      AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID: ...
      AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY: ...
      AWS_REGION: us-east-1
      S3_LOADER_BUCKET_ROUTER_CONFIG: /etc/imagor/bucket-routing.yaml
    ports:
      - "8000:8000"
```

#### Google Cloud Storage

Docker Compose example with Google Cloud Storage:

```yaml
version: "3"
services:
  imagor:
    image: shumc/imagor:latest
    volumes:
      - ./googlesecret:/etc/secrets/google
    environment:
      PORT: 8000
      IMAGOR_SECRET: mysecret # secret key for URL signature
      GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS: /etc/secrets/google/appcredentials.json # google cloud secrets file

      GCLOUD_LOADER_BUCKET: mybucket # enable loader by specifying bucket
      GCLOUD_LOADER_BASE_DIR: images # optional

      GCLOUD_STORAGE_BUCKET: mybucket # enable storage by specifying bucket
      GCLOUD_STORAGE_BASE_DIR: images # optional
      GCLOUD_STORAGE_ACL: publicRead # optional - see https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/json_api/v1/objects/insert

      GCLOUD_RESULT_STORAGE_BUCKET: mybucket # enable result storage by specifying bucket
      GCLOUD_RESULT_STORAGE_BASE_DIR: images/result # optional
      GCLOUD_RESULT_STORAGE_ACL: publicRead # optional
    ports:
      - "8000:8000"
```

#### Storage and Result Storage Path Style

`Storage` and `Result Storage` path style enables additional hashing rules to the storage path when loading and saving images:

`IMAGOR_STORAGE_PATH_STYLE=digest`

* `foobar.jpg` becomes `e6/86/1a810ff186b4f747ef85f7c53946f0e6d8cb`

`IMAGOR_RESULT_STORAGE_PATH_STYLE=digest`

* `fit-in/16x17/foobar.jpg` becomes `61/4c/9ba1725e8cdd8263a4ad437c56b35f33deba`

`IMAGOR_RESULT_STORAGE_PATH_STYLE=suffix`

* `166x169/top/foobar.jpg` becomes `foobar.45d8ebb31bd4ed80c26e.jpg`
* `17x19/smart/example.com/foobar` becomes `example.com/foobar.ddd349e092cda6d9c729`

`IMAGOR_RESULT_STORAGE_PATH_STYLE=size`

* `166x169/top/foobar.jpg` becomes `foobar.45d8ebb31bd4ed80c26e_166x169.jpg`
* `17x19/smart/example.com/foobar` becomes `example.com/foobar.ddd349e092cda6d9c729_17x19`

### Security

#### URL Signature

In production environment, it is highly recommended turning off `IMAGOR_UNSAFE` and setting up URL signature using `IMAGOR_SECRET`, to prevent DDoS attacks that abuse multiple image operations.

The URL signature hash is based on SHA digest, created by taking the URL path (excluding `/unsafe/`) with secret. The hash is then Base64 URL encoded.
An example in Node.js:

```javascript
const crypto = require('crypto');

function sign(path, secret) {
  const hash = crypto.createHmac('sha1', secret)
          .update(path)
          .digest('base64')
          .replace(/\+/g, '-').replace(/\//g, '_')
  return hash + '/' + path
}

console.log(sign('500x500/top/raw.githubusercontent.com/cshum/imagor/master/testdata/gopher.png', 'mysecret'))
// cST4Ko5_FqwT3BDn-Wf4gO3RFSk=/500x500/top/raw.githubusercontent.com/cshum/imagor/master/testdata/gopher.png
```

#### Custom HMAC Signer

imagor uses SHA1 HMAC signer by default, the same one used by [thumbor](https://thumbor.readthedocs.io/en/latest/security.html#hmac-method). However, SHA1 is not considered cryptographically secure. If that is a concern it is possible to configure different signing method and truncate length. imagor supports `sha1`, `sha256`, `sha512` signer type:

```dotenv
IMAGOR_SIGNER_TYPE=sha256
IMAGOR_SIGNER_TRUNCATE=40
```

The Node.js example then becomes:

```javascript
const crypto = require('crypto');

function sign(path, secret) {
  const hash = crypto.createHmac('sha256', secret)
          .update(path)
          .digest('base64')
          .slice(0, 40)
          .replace(/\+/g, '-').replace(/\//g, '_')
  return hash + '/' + path
}

console.log(sign('500x500/top/raw.githubusercontent.com/cshum/imagor/master/testdata/gopher.png', 'mysecret'))
// IGEn3TxngivD0jy4uuiZim2bdUCvhcnVi1Nm0xGy/500x500/top/raw.githubusercontent.com/cshum/imagor/master/testdata/gopher.png
```

#### Image Bombs Prevention

imagor checks the image type and its resolution before the actual processing happens. The processing will be rejected if the image dimensions are too big, which protects from so-called "image bombs". You can set the max allowed image resolution and dimensions using `VIPS_MAX_RESOLUTION`, `VIPS_MAX_WIDTH`, `VIPS_MAX_HEIGHT`:

```dotenv
VIPS_MAX_RESOLUTION=16800000
VIPS_MAX_WIDTH=5000
VIPS_MAX_HEIGHT=5000
```

#### VIPS Performance Tuning

imagor uses [libvips](https://github.com/libvips/libvips) for image processing. libvips provides several configuration options to tune performance and resource usage:

##### Concurrency

`VIPS_CONCURRENCY` controls the number of threads libvips uses for image operations:

```dotenv
VIPS_CONCURRENCY=1    # Single-threaded (default)
VIPS_CONCURRENCY=-1   # Use all available CPU cores
VIPS_CONCURRENCY=4    # Use 4 threads
```

**Important:** `VIPS_CONCURRENCY` is a **global setting** that controls threading **within each image operation**, not the number of concurrent requests. 

- **Default (1)**: Single-threaded processing. Recommended for most deployments where you handle concurrency at the application level (multiple imagor processes/containers).
- **-1 (auto)**: Uses all CPU cores. Can improve performance for individual large images but may cause resource contention under high request concurrency.
- **Custom value**: Set to a specific number of threads for fine-tuned control.

For high-traffic deployments, it's generally better to scale horizontally (more imagor instances) rather than increasing `VIPS_CONCURRENCY`.

##### Operation Cache

libvips caches recently used operations to improve performance when processing similar images. These settings control the cache behavior:

```dotenv
VIPS_MAX_CACHE_MEM=50000000     # Max memory for operation cache (bytes)
VIPS_MAX_CACHE_SIZE=100         # Max number of operations to cache
VIPS_MAX_CACHE_FILES=0          # Max number of file descriptors to cache
```

**When to adjust:**
- **Web servers** (many different images, few operations each): Keep defaults low or disable caching entirely (set to 0). The operation cache is less useful when each request processes a unique image.
- **Batch processing** (few images, many operations): Increase cache limits to reuse operations across multiple transformations of the same images.

**Default behavior:** libvips uses small cache limits suitable for web serving. For most imagor deployments, the defaults are appropriate.

See [libvips operation cache documentation](https://github.com/libvips/libvips/issues/1585) for more details.

#### Allowed Sources and Base URL

Whitelist specific hosts to restrict loading images only from the allowed sources using `HTTP_LOADER_ALLOWED_SOURCES` or `HTTP_LOADER_ALLOWED_SOURCE_REGEXP`.

- `HTTP_LOADER_ALLOWED_SOURCES` accepts csv wth glob pattern e.g.:

  ```dotenv
  HTTP_LOADER_ALLOWED_SOURCES=*.foobar.com,my.foobar.com,mybucket.s3.amazonaws.com
  ```

- `HTTP_LOADER_ALLOWED_SOURCE_REGEXP` accepts a regular expression matching on the full URL e.g.:

  ```dotenv
  HTTP_LOADER_ALLOWED_SOURCE_REGEXP='^https://raw\.githubusercontent\.com/cshum/imagor/.*'
  ```

Alternatively, it is possible to set a base URL for loading images strictly from one HTTP source. This also trims down the base URL from image endpoint:

Example URL:
```
http://localhost:8000/unsafe/fit-in/200x150/filters:fill(yellow):watermark(raw.githubusercontent.com/cshum/imagor/master/testdata/gopher-front.png,repeat,bottom,0,40,40)/raw.githubusercontent.com/cshum/imagor/master/testdata/dancing-banana.gif
```

With HTTP Loader Base URL config:
```
HTTP_LOADER_BASE_URL=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cshum/imagor/master
```

The example URL then becomes:
```
http://localhost:8000/unsafe/fit-in/200x150/filters:fill(yellow):watermark(testdata/gopher-front.png,repeat,bottom,0,40,40)/testdata/dancing-banana.gif
```

### ImageMagick Support

imagor uses [libvips](https://github.com/libvips/libvips) which is typically 4-8x [faster](https://github.com/libvips/libvips/wiki/Speed-and-memory-use) than ImageMagick with better memory efficiency and security. However, there are image formats that libvips cannot handle natively, such as PSD, BMP, XCF and other legacy formats.

imagor provides an ImageMagick-enabled variant that includes ImageMagick support through libvips `magickload` operation. This allows processing additional file formats but with performance and security tradeoffs.

**ImageMagick is not recommended for speed, memory and security** but is capable of opening files that libvips won't support natively.

#### Docker build `imagor-magick`

```bash
docker pull ghcr.io/cshum/imagor-magick
```

Usage:

```bash
docker run -p 8000:8000 ghcr.io/cshum/imagor-magick -imagor-unsafe -imagor-auto-webp
```

We recommend using the standard imagor image for most use cases.

### MozJPEG Support

By default, imagor uses libjpeg-turbo for JPEG encoding, which provides fast compression. For enhanced JPEG compression at the cost of slower encoding speed, imagor provides a MozJPEG-enabled variant that includes [MozJPEG](https://github.com/mozilla/mozjpeg) support through libvips.

MozJPEG improves JPEG compression efficiency while maintaining compatibility with existing JPEG decoders. It can reduce JPEG file sizes up to 30% compared to libjpeg-turbo while maintaining the same visual quality, but with slower encoding performance.

#### Docker build `imagor-mozjpeg`

```bash
docker pull ghcr.io/cshum/imagor-mozjpeg
```

Usage:

```bash
docker run -p 8000:8000 ghcr.io/cshum/imagor-mozjpeg -imagor-unsafe -vips-mozjpeg
```

#### Enabling MozJPEG

MozJPEG can be enabled using the `-vips-mozjpeg` command-line argument, or the equivalent environment variable:

```bash
VIPS_MOZJPEG=1
```

Docker Compose example:

```yaml
version: "3"
services:
  imagor:
    image: ghcr.io/cshum/imagor-mozjpeg:latest
    environment:
      PORT: 8000
      IMAGOR_UNSAFE: 1
      VIPS_MOZJPEG: 1  # Enable MozJPEG compression
    ports:
      - "8000:8000"
```

When enabled, MozJPEG will be used for JPEG output, providing better compression efficiency for JPEG images.

### Metadata and Exif

imagor provides metadata endpoint that extracts information such as image format, resolution and Exif metadata.
Under the hood, it tries to retrieve data just enough to extract the header, without reading and processing the whole image in memory.

To use the metadata endpoint, add `/meta` right after the URL signature hash before the image operations. Example:

```
http://localhost:8000/unsafe/meta/fit-in/50x50/raw.githubusercontent.com/cshum/imagor/master/testdata/Canon_40D.jpg
```

```jsonc
{
  "format": "jpeg",
  "content_type": "image/jpeg",
  "width": 50,
  "height": 34,
  "orientation": 1,
  "pages": 1,
  "bands": 3,
  "exif": {
    "ApertureValue": "368640/65536",
    "ColorSpace": 1,
    "ComponentsConfiguration": "Y Cb Cr -",
    "Compression": 6,
    "DateTime": "2008:07:31 10:38:11",
    "ISOSpeedRatings": 100,
    "Make": "Canon",
    "MeteringMode": 5,
    "Model": "Canon EOS 40D",
    //...
  }
}
```

Prepending `/params` to the existing endpoint returns the endpoint attributes in JSON form, useful for previewing the endpoint parameters. Example:
```bash
curl 'http://localhost:8000/params/g5bMqZvxaQK65qFPaP1qlJOTuLM=/fit-in/500x400/0x20/filters:fill(white)/raw.githubusercontent.com/cshum/imagor/master/testdata/gopher.png'
```

### POST Upload Endpoint

imagor supports POST uploads for direct image processing and transformation. 

Upload functionality is an **opt-in feature** designed for **internal use** where imagor serves as a backend service in trusted environments with proper access controls, not for public-facing endpoints. 
When enabled, it requires both flags to be explicitly set:

- **Unsafe mode** (`IMAGOR_UNSAFE=1`) - disables URL signature verification
- **Upload Loader** (`UPLOAD_LOADER_ENABLE=1`) - enables POST upload functionality

Usage:

```bash
docker run -p 8000:8000 shumc/imagor -imagor-unsafe -upload-loader-enable
```

```dotenv
IMAGOR_UNSAFE=1
UPLOAD_LOADER_ENABLE=1
```

Upload an image using POST request to any imagor endpoint. The URL path defines the image operations to apply:

```bash
# Upload and resize to 300x200
curl -X POST -F "image=@photo.jpg" http://localhost:8000/unsafe/300x200/

# Upload with filters applied
curl -X POST -F "image=@photo.jpg" \
  http://localhost:8000/unsafe/fit-in/400x300/filters:quality(80):format(webp)/
```

When upload is enabled, visiting processing paths in a browser shows a built-in upload form:

- `http://localhost:8000/unsafe/200x200/` - Upload form with 200x200 resize
- `http://localhost:8000/unsafe/filters:blur(5)/` - Upload form with blur filter

The upload form includes debug information showing how imagor parses the URL parameters, useful for testing and development.

### Configuration

imagor supports command-line arguments and environment variables for the arguments equivalent in capitalized snake case, see available options `imagor -h`.
For instances `-imagor-secret` would become `IMAGOR_SECRET`:

```bash
# both are equivalent

imagor -debug -imagor-secret 1234

DEBUG=1 IMAGOR_SECRET=1234 imagor
```

Configuration can also be specified in a `.env` environment variable file and referenced with the `-config` flag:

```bash
imagor -config path/to/config.env
```

config.env:

```dotenv
